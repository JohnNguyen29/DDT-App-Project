This is the code for my NCEA subject tracker and course checker.
The app has 4 main Python scripts (one for each page) and 2 scripts that populate the database
Most functions and features work the way it intended, but some can be improved with more time, skill, and knowledge.
Progress was firstly documented through manually uploading to Github and then through commits.
Decomp progress was done through git commits since isolating a feature would not show me if the feature is working as intended.
I have pushed commits whenever I can to show the development of my different components/features.
